# TexasHoldem

## Description

This is a program that currently generates 8 random players and simulates a hand of texas holdem.  Currently, it can determine what hand each player has
and can then determine which player won the hand based on the cards dealt.  The code is messy, but I plan to clean it up eventually.  It's still a little buggy in
that some hands still fail to register a win when they should, but it is still a work in progress.
